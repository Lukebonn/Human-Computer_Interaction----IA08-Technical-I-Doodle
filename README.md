# Human-Computer_Interaction----IA08-Technical-I-Doodle
This is the repository for one of the many class projects for University of Delaware's CISC482 Intro to Human-Computer Interaction in Fall of 2025.

This was a project created and edited entirely within Android Studio using mainly the Kotlin coding language. All of the code here are the generated files except for this file app/src/main/java/com/example/ia08technicali__doodle__lukebonniwell/MainActivity.kt, which was the only file edited for this project. This file was changed and then tested using the "Pixel 9a API 36.1" emulator. 

I am very proud of this project, so I just ask that anyone who chooses to look into my code replicates it or reads through it does so with the same amount of time and care I spent on it.
